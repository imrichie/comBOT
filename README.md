This app was created in a 36 hour long hackathon at California Institute of Technology.

## What it does
With comBOT, simply query a compound structure with voice, and receive the compound name and much more. On the backend comBOT is designed with latest in intelligence. comBOT converts audio to text, understands users intent, and converts text back to speech for natural responsiveness.

## How we built it
We as a team worked as a TEAM! initially trained a model with NLP to recognize the intent of our speech. We processed the audio into text. We had to deserialize our output files to a readable file and send for query into the Wolfram engine to return a desired result. We then built the UI to polish our product.

## Challenges we ran into
Getting our product from idea to life was the first challenge. As we narrowed our expectations for this hackathon we started running into problems with integration, then certain libraries weren't working or being uploaded. After hours of working towards solutions we had to drop some original features to find other ways while keeping our focus on original intent. It was a challenge to use Android environment.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
When we started and brainstormed the project it was minimal. As we gathered knowledge attending the workshops we were inspired and decided to further our expectations to produce a great product! A product we could look back and if nothing else we could be proud of our ideas and actions! We implemented intelligence into our product with NLP and speech recognition couple of technologies that each of us were afraid of or didn't think we'd approach anytime soon.

## What I learned
We grew, learned and overcame a ton of boundaries. None of us had any Android experience or prepared for the challenges. We learned to be more collaborative, on the technical side we learned to use Microsoft Cognitive services, Java language, Android environment, Speech recognition, Cloud services, Bots and NLP

## What's next for comBOT
We are going to try and take this app and further the development, potentially adding ML and AI to it, more interaction and responsive.
